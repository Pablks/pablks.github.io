                <h6>Domain Name System</h6>
                <h1>Wat is DNS?</h1>
                <p>DNS, or Domain Name System, is the Internet's phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like nytimes.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses. Each device on the Internet has a unique IP address, and DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize these addresses. DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to locate the desired Internet device, similar to using a street address to find a home.</p>
                <div class="sep"></div>
                <h1>Steps in a DNS lookup:</h1>
                <ul class="indent" style="list-style: decimal;">
                    <li>User types a domain name (e.g., example.com) into the web browser.</li>
                    <li>Web browser sends a DNS query to the local resolver.</li>
                    <li>Local resolver checks its cache; if not found, it contacts the root DNS server.</li>
                    <li>Root DNS server directs to the top-level domain (TLD) DNS server.</li>
                    <li>TLD DNS server guides to the authoritative DNS server for the domain.</li>
                    <li>Authoritative DNS server provides the IP address to the local resolver.</li>
                    <li>Local resolver stores the IP in its cache and returns it to the browser.</li>
                    <li>Browser uses the IP to load the desired webpage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: DNS lookup steps may vary when information is cached, skipping some steps for faster retrieval.</p>

                <h6>Hosting</h6>
                <p>Web hosting is like renting space on the internet to store and make your website accessible to users worldwide. It involves storing your website's files, data, and content on a server, which is a powerful computer that's always connected to the internet. When someone types your website's domain name into their browser, the hosting server delivers the necessary files to display the webpage, allowing users to access and interact with your site.</p>
                <p>Web hosting providers offer various plans with different levels of resources and features, catering to the needs of different websites. These plans typically include storage space, bandwidth, and other services like security features and support. Choosing the right web hosting service is crucial for the performance, reliability, and security of your website, as it directly impacts how fast your site loads and how well it can handle traffic and user interactions.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h6>TCP/IP</h6>
                <h1>What are TCP & IP?</h1>
                <p>IP is like a courier that takes messages from one place to another on the internet. Its job is simple: deliver packets of information. However, IP doesn't bother with making sure the packets are in the right order or checking if there are any mistakes.</p>
                <p>That's where TCP comes in. TCP works together with IP to ensure a smooth and reliable communication process. Think of it like sending a puzzle through the mail. IP is the courier that gets the puzzle pieces to the destination, but they might be out of order or have missing parts.</p>
                <p>TCP acts as the puzzle assembler on the other end. It arranges the pieces in the correct order, asks for any missing ones to be sent again, and confirms to the sender that the puzzle has been received. This way, TCP maintains a connection between the sender and the receiver, making sure everything is organized and correct.</p>
                <p>For instance, when you send an email over TCP, there's a setup process called a 3-way handshake. It's like a conversation between the sender and the receiver before the actual message is sent. Once the connection is established, the email message is broken down into smaller packets, sent over the internet, and then reassembled at the destination by TCP.</p>
                <p>In summary, IP handles the basic job of delivering messages, while TCP takes care of the details to ensure a reliable and ordered communication process.</p>

        <section id="https" class="gray">
            <div class="content">
                <h6>HTTP/HTTPS</h6>
                <h1>What is HTTP?</h1>
                <p>HTTP is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for transmitting data over a network, and it forms the basis for most Internet communication. It operates at the application layer in the OSI model. HTTP involves two main types of messages: requests, generated by a user's browser when interacting with web content, and responses, which are answers to those requests.</p>
                <div class="sep"></div>
                <h1>What is HTTPS?</h1>
                <p>On the other hand, HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is essentially the same as HTTP but with added security. The primary difference lies in encryption and verification. HTTPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to encrypt HTTP requests and responses, ensuring a secure and private connection. Websites using HTTPS have "https://" in their URLs, indicating a higher level of security compared to HTTP's "http://".</p>
                <p>In summary, HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP, incorporating encryption and verification mechanisms to safeguard data transmitted between a user's browser and a website. The "S" in HTTPS stands for "Secure," highlighting the enhanced security measures it employs compared to the standard HTTP.</p>

        <section id="packets">
            <div class="content">
                <h6>Packet</h6>
                <h1>What is a Packet?</h1>
                <p>A packet in networking is a small part of a larger message, dividing data sent over computer networks into manageable segments. These packets are later reassembled by the receiving computer or device. It's akin to breaking a letter into index cards for a narrow mail slot. On the Internet, when a user requests, say, an image, it doesn't arrive in one piece; instead, it is broken into packets, sent over the Internet's infrastructure, and then reconstructed by the user's computer.</p>
                <div class="sep"></div>
                <h1>Why use Packets?</h1>
                <p>Using packets is essential for efficient data transmission. While theoretically, sending data as an unbroken line of bits could work, it becomes impractical when multiple computers are involved. The Internet employs "packet switching," allowing networking equipment to process packets independently. This means multiple packets can take different paths to the same destination, optimizing network usage. Packet switching enables billions of devices to exchange data simultaneously, making the Internet a dynamic and efficient network of interconnected computers.</p>

        <section id="practice" class="gray">
            <div class="content">
                <h6>In Practice</h6>
                <h1>So how does a network work?</h1>
                <p>Networks rely on packets for communication. These are small units of data that devices exchange to transmit information efficiently. A central device, such as a switch, hub, or router, plays a crucial role in managing and directing the flow of these packets.</p>
                <p>The central device acts as a traffic controller, determining the path that each packet should take to reach its intended destination. This ensures that data travels efficiently across the network. Whether through a wired connection using Ethernet cables or a wireless connection via a Wireless Access Point, devices become integral components of the network.</p>
                <p>In a wired setup, Ethernet cables physically link devices to the central unit, allowing for reliable and high-speed data transmission. On the other hand, wireless networks utilize a Wireless Access Point to enable communication without the need for physical connections. This flexibility is especially beneficial in environments where mobility is essential.</p>                
                <p>In summary, networks function as a dynamic ecosystem where devices communicate through the exchange of packets. The central device orchestrates this communication, ensuring an organized and efficient flow of data, whether through wired connections or wireless access points.</p>
