                <h6>Domain Name System</h6>
                <h1>Wat is DNS?</h1>
                <p>DNS, or Domain Name System, is the Internet's phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like nytimes.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses. Each device on the Internet has a unique IP address, and DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize these addresses. DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (e.g., www.example.com) into an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to locate the desired Internet device, similar to using a street address to find a home.</p>
                <div class="sep"></div>
                <h1>Setps in a DNS lookup:</h1>
                <ul class="indent" style="list-style: decimal;">
                    <li>User types a domain name (e.g., example.com) into the web browser.</li>
                    <li>Web browser sends a DNS query to the local resolver.</li>
                    <li>Local resolver checks its cache; if not found, it contacts the root DNS server.</li>
                    <li>Root DNS server directs to the top-level domain (TLD) DNS server.</li>
                    <li>TLD DNS server guides to the authoritative DNS server for the domain.</li>
                    <li>Authoritative DNS server provides the IP address to the local resolver.</li>
                    <li>Local resolver stores the IP in its cache and returns it to the browser.</li>
                    <li>Browser uses the IP to load the desired webpage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: DNS lookup steps may vary when information is cached, skipping some steps for faster retrieval.</p>

                <h6>Hosting</h6>
                <p>Web hosting is like renting space on the internet to store and make your website accessible to users worldwide. It involves storing your website's files, data, and content on a server, which is a powerful computer that's always connected to the internet. When someone types your website's domain name into their browser, the hosting server delivers the necessary files to display the webpage, allowing users to access and interact with your site.</p>
                <p>Web hosting providers offer various plans with different levels of resources and features, catering to the needs of different websites. These plans typically include storage space, bandwidth, and other services like security features and support. Choosing the right web hosting service is crucial for the performance, reliability, and security of your website, as it directly impacts how fast your site loads and how well it can handle traffic and user interactions.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h6>TCP/IP</h6>
                <h1>What are TCP & IP?</h1>
                <p>IP is like a courier that takes messages from one place to another on the internet. Its job is simple: deliver packets of information. However, IP doesn't bother with making sure the packets are in the right order or checking if there are any mistakes.</p>
                <p>That's where TCP comes in. TCP works together with IP to ensure a smooth and reliable communication process. Think of it like sending a puzzle through the mail. IP is the courier that gets the puzzle pieces to the destination, but they might be out of order or have missing parts.</p>
                <p>TCP acts as the puzzle assembler on the other end. It arranges the pieces in the correct order, asks for any missing ones to be sent again, and confirms to the sender that the puzzle has been received. This way, TCP maintains a connection between the sender and the receiver, making sure everything is organized and correct.</p>
                <p>For instance, when you send an email over TCP, there's a setup process called a 3-way handshake. It's like a conversation between the sender and the receiver before the actual message is sent. Once the connection is established, the email message is broken down into smaller packets, sent over the internet, and then reassembled at the destination by TCP.</p>
                <p>In summary, IP handles the basic job of delivering messages, while TCP takes care of the details to ensure a reliable and ordered communication process.</p>
