                <h1>Domain Name System</h1>
                <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
                <p><span>DNS</span>, or Domain Name System, is the Internet's phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like nytimes.com) into computer-friendly <span>IP</span> addresses. Each device on the Internet has a unique <span>IP</span> address, and <span>DNS</span> servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize these addresses. <span>DNS</span> resolution involves converting a hostname (e.g., www.example.com) into an <span>IP</span> address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to locate the desired Internet device, similar to using a street address to find a home.</p>
                <h2>Steps in a DNS lookup:</h2>
                <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                    <li>User types a domain name (e.g., example.com) into the web browser.</li>
                    <li>Web browser sends a <span>DNS</span> query to the local resolver.</li>
                    <li>Local resolver checks its cache; if not found, it contacts the root <span>DNS</span> server.</li>
                    <li>Root <span>DNS</span> server directs to the top-level domain (TLD) <span>DNS</span> server.</li>
                    <li>TLD <span>DNS</span> server guides to the authoritative <span>DNS</span> server for the domain.</li>
                    <li>Authoritative <span>DNS</span> server provides the <span>IP</span> address to the local resolver.</li>
                    <li>Local resolver stores the <span>IP</span> in its cache and returns it to the browser.</li>
                    <li>Browser uses the <span>IP</span> to load the desired webpage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: <span>DNS</span> lookup steps may vary when information is cached, skipping some steps for faster retrieval.</p>

                <h2>What is Hosting?</h2>
                <p><span>Hosting</span> is like renting space on the <span>internet</span> to store and make your <span>website</span> accessible to users worldwide. It involves storing your <span>website</span>'s files, <span>data</span>, and content on a server, which is a powerful computer that's always connected to the <span>internet</span>. When someone types your <span>website</span>'s domain name into their browser, the hosting server delivers the necessary files to display the webpage, allowing users to access and interact with your site.</p>
                <p>Hosting providers offer various plans with different levels of resources and features, catering to the needs of different <span>websites</span>. These plans typically include storage space, <span>bandwidth</span>, and other services like security features and support. Choosing the right web <span>hosting</span> service is crucial for the performance, reliability, and security of your <span>website</span>, as it directly impacts how fast your site loads and how well it can handle traffic and user interactions.</p>

                <h1>TCP/IP?</h1>
                <h2>What are TCP & IP?</h2>
                <p><span>IP</span> is like a courier that takes messages from one place to another on the <span>internet</span>. Its job is simple: deliver packets of information. However, <span>IP</span> doesn't bother with making sure the packets are in the right order or checking if there are any mistakes.</p>
                <p>That's where <span>TCP</span> comes in. <span>TCP</span> works together with <span>IP</span> to ensure a smooth and reliable communication process. Think of it like sending a puzzle through the mail. <span>IP</span> is the courier that gets the puzzle pieces to the destination, but they might be out of order or have missing parts.</p>
                <p><span>TCP</span> acts as the puzzle assembler on the other end. It arranges the pieces in the correct order, asks for any missing ones to be sent again, and confirms to the sender that the puzzle has been received. This way, <span>TCP</span> maintains a connection between the sender and the receiver, making sure everything is organized and correct.</p>
                <p>For instance, when you send an email over <span>TCP</span>, there's a setup process called a 3-way handshake. It's like a conversation between the sender and the receiver before the actual message is sent. Once the connection is established, the email message is broken down into smaller packets, sent over the <span>internet</span>, and then reassembled at the destination by <span>TCP</span>.</p>
                <p>In summary, <span>IP</span> handles the basic job of delivering messages, while <span>TCP</span> takes care of the details to ensure a reliable and ordered communication process.</p>

                <h1>HTTP/HTTPS</h1>
                <h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
                <p><span>HTTP</span> is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for transmitting <span>data</span> over a <span>network</span>, and it forms the basis for most Internet communication. It operates at the application layer in the OSI model. <span>HTTP</span> involves two main types of messages: requests, generated by a user's browser when interacting with web content, and responses, which are answers to those requests.</p>
                <h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, <span>HTTPS</span>, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is essentially the same as <span>HTTP</span> but with added security. The primary difference lies in encryption and verification. <span>HTTPS</span> uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to encrypt <span>HTTP</span> requests and responses, ensuring a secure and private connection. Websites using <span>HTTPS</span> have "https://" in their URLs, indicating a higher level of security compared to <span>HTTP</span>'s "http://".</p>
                <p>In summary, <span>HTTPS</span> is a more secure version of <span>HTTP</span>, incorporating encryption and verification mechanisms to safeguard <span>data</span> transmitted between a user's browser and a <span>website</span>. The "S" in <span>HTTPS</span> stands for "Secure", highlighting the enhanced security measures it employs compared to the standard <span>HTTP</span>.</p>

                    <li>How does HTTPS differ from HTTP in terms of security?</li>
                    <li>What encryption mechanisms does HTTPS use to secure data transmission?</li>
                    <li>Why is HTTPS considered more secure than HTTP?</li>

                <h1>Packets</h1>
                <h2>What is a Packet?</h2>
                <p>A <span>packet</span> in networking is a small part of a larger message, dividing <span>data</span> sent over computer networks into manageable segments. These packets are later reassembled by the receiving computer or device. It's akin to breaking a letter into index cards for a narrow mail slot. On the Internet, when a user requests, say, an image, it doesn't arrive in one piece; instead, it is broken into packets, sent over the Internet's infrastructure, and then reconstructed by the user's computer.</p>
                <h2>Why use Packets?</h2>
                <p>Using <span>packets</span> is essential for efficient <span>data</span> transmission. While theoretically, sending <span>data</span> as an unbroken line of bits could work, it becomes impractical when multiple computers are involved. The Internet employs "<span>packet</span> switching", allowing networking equipment to process <span>packets</span> independently. This means multiple <span>packets</span> can take different paths to the same destination, optimizing <span>network</span> usage. <span>Packet</span> switching enables billions of devices to exchange <span>data</span> simultaneously, making the Internet a dynamic and efficient <span>network</span> of interconnected computers.</p>
                <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                    <li>What is the purpose of breaking down data into packets in networking?</li>
                    <li>How does packet switching contribute to efficient data transmission?</li>
                    <li>Why is sending data as an unbroken line impractical in computer networks?</li>

                <h1>Networks</h1>
                <h2>So how do networks work?</h2>
                <p><span>Networks</span> rely on <span>packets</span> for communication. These are small units of <span>data</span> that devices exchange to transmit information efficiently. A central device, such as a <span>switch</span>, <span>hub</span>, or <span>router</span>, plays a crucial role in managing and directing the flow of these <span>packets</span>.</p>
                <p>The central device acts as a traffic controller, determining the path that each <span>packet</span> should take to reach its intended destination. This ensures that <span>data</span> travels efficiently across the <span>network</span>. Whether through a wired connection using Ethernet cables or a wireless connection via a <span>Wireless Access Point</span>, devices become integral components of the <span>network</span>.</p>
                <p>In a wired setup, Ethernet cables physically link devices to the central unit, allowing for reliable and high-speed <span>data</span> transmission. On the other hand, wireless networks utilize a Wireless Access Point to enable communication without the need for physical connections. This flexibility is especially beneficial in environments where mobility is essential.</p>
                <p>In summary, networks function as a dynamic ecosystem where devices communicate through the exchange of <span>packets</span>. The central device orchestrates this communication, ensuring an organized and efficient flow of <span>data</span>, whether through wired connections or wireless access points.</p>

                <h1>Answers</h1>
                <h2>DNS:</h2>
                <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                    <li>DNS serves as the Internet's address book, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>DNS eliminates the need for humans to remember complex IP addresses by providing a system to associate user-friendly domain names with numerical IP addresses.</li>
                    <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User types a domain name into the browser.</li>
                        <li>Browser sends a DNS query to the local resolver.</li>
                        <li>Local resolver checks cache; if not found, contacts root DNS server.</li>
                        <li>Root DNS server directs to the top-level domain (TLD) DNS server.</li>
                        <li>TLD DNS server guides to the authoritative DNS server for the domain.</li>
                        <li>Authoritative DNS server provides the IP address to the local resolver.</li>
                        <li>Local resolver stores the IP in its cache and returns it to the browser.</li>
                        <li>Browser uses the IP to load the webpage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The authoritative DNS server is responsible for providing the IP address associated with a specific domain name.</li>
                <li>DNS caching allows for faster retrieval of information by storing previously resolved domain-to-IP mappings, reducing the need for repeated queries.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Hosting:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hosting involves renting space on the internet to store and make a website accessible to users worldwide.</li>
                <li>The choice of web hosting service directly impacts website performance, including speed, reliability, and security.</li>
                <li>Hosting plans typically include storage space, bandwidth, security features, support services, and additional features based on the provider.</li>
                <li>The reliability of a hosting service is crucial for ensuring that a website remains accessible and performs well consistently.</li>
                <li>The hosting server delivers necessary files when users enter a website's domain, allowing them to access and interact with the site.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>TCP/IP</h2>
            <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                <li> IP serves as a courier, delivering packets of information, while TCP ensures reliable communication by organizing and confirming packet delivery.</li>
                <li>TCP collaborates with IP to ensure a smooth and reliable communication process, handling details such as packet order and completeness.</li>
                <li>The "3-way handshake" in TCP is a setup process before sending data, establishing a connection between the sender and receiver.</li>
                <li>TCP is necessary for organizing packet delivery, arranging pieces in the correct order, requesting missing ones, and confirming successful reception.</li>
                <li>In the analogy, IP is the courier delivering puzzle pieces, and TCP is the assembler ensuring the pieces are in the correct order, completing the puzzle.</li>            
            </ul>
